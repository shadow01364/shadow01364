# üí´ About Me
<br>I am a passionate developer dedicated to contributing to and collaborating on innovative projects. My objective is to create impactful solutions by leveraging technology and coding expertise.<br>
<br>Currently, I am deeply immersed in software development, driven by a strong curiosity about the underlying mechanics of technology. I particularly enjoy working with low-level languages such as C, exploring systems programming, and delving into computer hardware to gain a comprehensive understanding of how things work at their core.<br>
<br>I'm also deeply interested in cybersecurity, including ethical hacking and cryptosystems. I enjoy breaking things apart to learn how to make them stronger and more secure.<br>
<br>As a Computer Science student majoring in Applied Mathematics, I approach technical challenges with both practical skills and theoretical insight, enabling me to tackle complex problems efficiently.<br>
<br>Based remotely, I am always open to collaborating on exciting and impactful projects. I am actively seeking new opportunities to learn, contribute, and grow within this dynamic and fast-evolving field.<br>
<br>Let‚Äôs connect and build something meaningful together!<br>
